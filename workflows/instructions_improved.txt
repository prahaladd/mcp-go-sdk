We need to perform the below set of steps to create images using CanvaAI.

**IMPORTANT: Execute steps sequentially. Only proceed to the next step when the current step is completely finished.**

1. **Navigate to Canva.com**  
   - Open the browser and go to [https://www.canva.com](https://www.canva.com).  
   - Ensure the page is fully loaded before proceeding.
   - THEN proceed to Step 2.

2. **Click on the Canva AI Button**  
   - Take an ARIA snapshot to locate the "Canva AI" button.
   - Click on the "Canva AI" button using the selector you found in the ARIA snapshot.
   - Wait for the Canva AI interface to load completely.
   - Take an ARIA snapshot to verify the AI interface has loaded.
   - THEN proceed to Step 3.

3. **Enter Text in the AI Text Box**  
   - Take an ARIA snapshot of the Canva AI interface.
   - Locate the text input field with placeholder text "Describe your idea, and I'll bring it to life".
   - Enter the text `Moonlit Sunset` into this text box.
   - THEN proceed to Step 4.

4. **Submit the Request**  
   - Locate the submit button (may be labeled "->", "Generate", "Create", or similar).
   - Click on it to submit the input.
   - Wait for the AI to generate the response or output.
   - Take a screenshot to capture the results.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Always take an ARIA snapshot before trying to interact with elements.
- Use the exact selectors found in the ARIA snapshot.
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next.
